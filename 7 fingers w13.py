#COUNTING NUMBERS VIA FINGERS
#variables: Variables are containers for storing data values.
#Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.
#A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
#A function is defined as a block of organized, reusable code used to perform a single, related action. Python has many built-in functions; you can also create your own.
#Python has an input function which lets you ask a user for some text input.
#You call this function to tell the program to stop and wait for the user to key in the data. 

#int (signed integers) âˆ’ They are often called just integers or ints, are positive or negative whole numbers with no decimal point.#if statement:Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
#if statement:Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
#Equals: a == b
#Not Equals: a != b
#Less than: a < b
#Less than or equal to: a <= b
#Greater than: a > b
#Greater than or equal to: a >= b
#These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.
#An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.

#The modulus operator, sometimes also called the
#remainder operator or integer remainder operator works on integers (and integer expressions) and yields the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second.
#In Python, the modulus operator is a percent sign ( % ). The syntax is the same as for other operators.
