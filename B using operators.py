# i used operators
# i print used 
# Python print(). The print() function prints the given object to the standard output device (screen) or to the text stream file
# operators used : arthematic and logical
# true or false statements
# variables used are x,y,a,b,p,q,p,r,m,n

# all the arthematic operators are given below : 
# + Addition	Adds values on either side of the operator.	a + b = 30
# - Subtraction	Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand.	a – b = -10
# * Multiplication	Multiplies values on either side of the operator	a * b = 200
# / Division	Divides left hand operand by right hand operand	b / a = 2
# % Modulus	Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder	b % a = 0
# ** Exponent	Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators	a**b =10 to the power 20 
# // Floor Division -  −	9//2 = 4 and 9.0//2.0 = 4.0, -11//3 = -4, -11.0//3 = -4.0 

# all the logical operators are given below :
# ==	If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.	(a == b) is not true.
# !=	If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.	(a != b) is true.
# <>	If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.	(a <> b) is true. This is similar to != operator.
# >	If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a > b) is not true.
# <	If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a < b) is true.
# >=	If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a >= b) is not true.
# <=	If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a <= b) is true.
